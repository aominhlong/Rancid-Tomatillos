#### Testing the App
`End-to-end` testing was implimented to test the application by using Cypress. `Stubbing` and `intercepting` was used to control the network response. The app was fully tested based on the user story from start to finish. 

#### Challenges and Wins

##### Challenges
- Implementing search bar logic that rendered correctly depending on user's input.

##### Wins
- Learning to use React more in depth and reinforcing a good React workflow between components.

#### Project Overview And Goals
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Implement asynchronous JavaScript
- Practice refactoring

#### Future Additions
- Filter by genre
- Add browse genre carousel page
- A sample video from the movie should be played on the movie details page by clicking the grey play icon.
- Add a genre drop down menu where users can filter out movies based on their genre (using Express could help with this addition)
